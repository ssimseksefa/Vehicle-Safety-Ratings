# Executive Summary
In this project I will try to find whether certain vehicle types (make/model/year) are safer than others or not. To answer this question, I will investigate the whole reported traffic accident data and registered vehicles in the US. 
# Motivation
When deciding a car make model, the safety is always a major issue. It may be the most important feature. Although every advertisement claims that the vehicle is safe, I want to use the experienced facts. I am looking answer from accident reports data. 
# Data Question
There is a report from a nonprofit organization, The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) about death rates by make and model. https://www.iihs.org/api/datastoredocument/status-report/pdf/52/3

I want to look the whole crash data instead of fatal crashes. Hence the question of this project is more general: Which make, model vehicles are safer? 

# Schedule (through 1/9/2020)
1.	Get the Data (12/7/2019)
2.	Clean & Explore the Data (12/21/2019)
3.	Create Presentation of your Analysis (12/28/2019)
-     Should be a presentation, but could include a Jupyter Notebook or dashboard in Excel, Tableau, or PowerBI
4.	Internal demos (1/4/2020)
5.	Demo Day!! (1/9/2020)

# Data Sources
Accident & vehicles:

<ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/> 

Registered vehicles:
-   New York: https://data.ny.gov/browse?q=vehicle%20make%20&sortBy=relevance 
-   UK: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/all-vehicles-veh01
# Known Issues and Challenges
I could not find the record of all registered vehicles by make, model for overall U.S. yet. If there is no such available data I will look only for highly populated cities or states. I may look other countries’ crash reports and vehicles if I could not find enough data to make analysis.
